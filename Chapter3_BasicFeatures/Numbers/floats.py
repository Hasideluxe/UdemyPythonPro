# Floats in a computer represents rational numbers
# BUT: The computer has only a subset of the infinite set of rational numbers, since
# the computer has only a fixed size
# Floats are implemented as doubles (fixed as 64bits, in contrast to variable sized integers)

# sign: 1bit
# exponent: 11bits [-1022, 1023]
# significant digits: 52bits
